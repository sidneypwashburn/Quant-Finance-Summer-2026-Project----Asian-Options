# Asian Options
Our Erdos institute project was about Asian options. These are exotic options whose payoff is based on the average stock price between the start and expiration of the contract, rather than just the price at contract expiration.

## Notebooks in this repository
 - `Volatility` - implements Black-Scholes and binomial pricing models for European and American options, as well as analysis of volatility of historical oil data and implied volatilities from options data. This originally was supposed to also contain implied volatility for historical oil options data. However, we realized the data from [Databento](https://databento.com/) needs to be kept confidential, which means we unfortunately couldn't include this in our writeup.
 - `Monte_Carlo_methods` - calculates pricing of Asian options using Monte Carlo methods. Also computes delta and simulates a delta hedging strategy for Asian options
 - `Vecer PDE for Asian Options` - solves the Večeř PDE using a finite difference method.
 - `Comparisons` - Verifies that the Monte Carlo and Vecer methods give the same solutions for Asian option pricing. Also compares Asian and European call prices and deltas
